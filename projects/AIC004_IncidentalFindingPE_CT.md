# **Incidental pulmonary embolism (PE)**

| <b>Project Title</b> | Role of AI in detection of incidental Pulmonary Emboli |
| <b>Clinical lead(s)</b> | TBC |
| <b>CSC lead</b> | [Simone](/team/Simone.html) |
| <b>Rationale</b> | Incidental findings of Pulmonary Emboli on routine cancer surveillance CT scans with contrast agent(Thorax/Abdomen/Pelvis)  |
| <b>Modality</b> | Contrast enhanced CT (Thorax/Abdomen/Pelvis)  |
| <b>Pathology</b> | Pulmonary Emboli (Incidental Findings)|
| <b>Description</b> | A computer aided diagnosis tool which supports the clinician for the detection of incidental Pulmonary Emboli during cancer follow up exams. Contrast enhanced CT scans (Thorax, Pelvis, Abdomen) are routinely performed on for cancer surveillance and provide the ideal contrast to detect PE. GSTT has currently 7 days turn-around timescale for reporting CTs, with the risk that the pathology progresses causing morbidity or mortality. The tool will support identification and prioritisation of the scans, reducing delayed diagnosis and enabling earlier  |

| <b>Training datasets</b> | Commercial product to be evaluated  |
| <b>Consequences of errors</b> | Morbidity or mortality if treatment is delayed |
| <b>Goals</b> | An automated tool for identifying and prioritising patients with PE |
| <b>Criteria for success</b> | Earlier identification of the pathology and prompt treatment |
