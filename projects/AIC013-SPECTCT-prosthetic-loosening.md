# **Prosthetic Loosening**

| Project Title | SPECT CT and evaluation of prosthetic loosening |

| --- | --- |
| <b>Rationale</b> | Prosthetic loosening is definitively diagnosed with a SPECT/CT. Around 40% of cases are not obvious and in 20% of cases the report is changed with further consultation. An AI tool would help in accuracy and increase confidence in reporting. |

| <b>Modality</b> | SPECT/CT |
| --- | --- |
| <b>Pathology</b> | Prosthetic loosening – mostly hip and knees, occasional elbow and shoulder |
| --- | --- |
| <b>Description</b> | Bone scan and SPECT CT are effective ways of assessing loosening as the metal artefact reduces the clarity of other imaging modalities. Patients will also be referred to x-ray and CT, but SPECT/CT supersedes these for accuracy. |
| --- | --- |
| <b>Patient pathway</b> | Patients are referred as a result of:<br><br>1 – pain in the replacement site<br>2 – x-ray investigations suggest loosening<br><br>Patients are referred from orthopaedics and surgery to consider replacement of a prosthesis or to revise the replacement. Next steps are decided by SPECT/CT reports. SPECT/CT is also used for surveillance so imaging is repeated in intervals.

| <b>Training datasets</b> | 250 patients annually. Data to be gathered retrospectively. |
| --- | --- |
| <b>Consequences of errors</b> | When the diagnosis of prosthetic loosening is missed, the patient remains in chronic (severe) pain for a prolonged amount of time. When the diagnosis of prosthetic loosening is incorrect, patient undergoes unnecessary surgery.  |
| --- | --- |
| <b>Goals</b> | Reducing patient pain and avoiding unnecessary surgery. Improving diagnosis speed and accuracy.  |
| --- | --- |
| <b>Criteria for success</b> | Increased diagnostic accuracy and thus reduction in unnecessary surgery, increase in speed with which loosening is diagnosed. |
