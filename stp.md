### Other
- MSc program for Clinical Bioinformatics (physical sciences) which is run by Manchester Academy for HCS education: https://mahse.co.uk/for-supervisors/. It seems most of the course is delivered by the university of Liverpool.

- Course leader for the MSc is: Helen Boston hboston@liverpool.ac.uk (see attached presentation in email on this – bit old but gives some further contact details etc)
 
- Here’s an overview of the dates trainees would be expected to do their lectures:
    - Year one:
        - 3 weeks in October, 1 week in January and 1 week in February (teaching in January and February to take place at the University of Liverpool)
    - Year two (University of Liverpool):
        - 1 week October, 1 week January, 1 week February and 2 weeks in March
    - Year three:
        - Research project https://mahse.co.uk/research-ethics-2016-17/ - be worth checking whether MAHSE or the University of Liverpool governs the ethics for this programme
 
- You should include these rough dates in your training plan for the STP trainee – even though they might change in the future, as it shows you’ve considered the time the trainee should spend on their MSc.
