| Rationale | 77% of scans with vertebral compression fractures are correctly identified and 43% scans recommend referrals â€“ both of these numbers can be improved with AI tool. |
| --- | --- |
| Modality | CT first, then x-ray, then MRI. |

| Pathology | Vertebral compression fractures (spine) |

| Description | Background osteoporosis is easily treatable if identified, but can lead to complex fractures at other sites if undiagnosed, especially in the hip where a > 50% mortality at 12 months over the age of 80. Currently, 70% of vertebral compression fractures are undiagnosed though they are the most common osteoporotic fracture. This project would work in conjunction with the current fracture liaison service quality improvement project. |

| Patient pathway | Incidental findings, patients present for imaging for other reasons. |
| --- | --- |
| Training datasets | Clinical datasets are available (CT, MRI, x-rays). Imaging usually performed for other indications. |
| --- | --- |
| Consequences of errors | A timely identification of vertebral compression fractures which indicate osteoporosis allows the clinicians to refer the patient for osteoporosis treatment. If the osteoporosis signs are missed and the patient sustains a fracture, the fracture is complex and carries a high rate of mortality in older patients. |
| --- | --- |
| Goals | Increased rates of identification and treatment referrals after identification to reduce occurrence of complex fractures in other sites. |
| --- | --- |
| Criteria for success | Increased referrals and identifications of vertebral compression fractures. |
