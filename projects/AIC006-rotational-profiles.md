| <b>Rationale</b> | Assessment of rotational profiles is time consuming and complex. An AI algorithm would significantly decrease the amount of time needed to measure the angles of rotation. |
| --- | --- |
| <b>Modality</b> | CT |
| --- | --- |
| <b>Pathology</b> | Lower limb rotation |
| --- | --- |
| <b>Description</b> | Current practice of manually drawing lines over the long bones and the joints on CT images in PACS to figure the degree of misalignment is time consuming (15-20 minutes per case). An AI tool would automatically create these lines and angles, saving time and reducing variability. |
| --- | --- |
| <b>Patient pathway</b> | Patients are referred by the orthopaedic team. CT imaging is part of the pre-surgical work up. The report is used to plan the surgical intervention. |
| --- | --- |
| <b>Training datasets</b> | Over 100 patients are referred annually. The data will be retrospective, acquiring a large cohort of patients and segmentation and profile results as annotated on PACS. It is possible annotations will need to be re-done if they cannot be exported from PACS. |

| <b>Consequences of errors</b> | The tool is to help find the accurate rotational profile and will be supervised and signed off by the radiologist, so an error is unlikely to persist far enough to affect a patient. |
| --- | --- |
| <b>Goals</b> | Reduction of radiologist time in reporting these scans as well as increase consistency in calculation. |

| <b>Criteria for success</b> | Accurate, automated rotational profiles. |
