# **Clinical Scientific Computing Workshop- The pathway to integrating AI (Artificial Intelligence) into NHS Practice**


The implementation of any change within the NHS is always a complex process and this is certainly no different for the application of AI or Machine Learning technologies. The addition of new technology within the NHS is not a new concept, many would not think twice now about sending request for investigations or appointments electronically and how this has evolved from postal systems, and the dull tones of a fax machine printing.<br>  
Maybe the most common fear is that machines will replace human contact. The view from this team and our NHS Trust is the technology we aim to integrate will not replace individual people or teams but will improve the delivery of care, to be personalised, safe and improve our patient outcomes. <br>
<br>
How do we do this though? There are no user guides, textbooks, guidelines, or standards of practice to follow for the unique pathway of the integration of AI and Machine learning technologies into the NHS. <br> 
<br>
As a new team starting at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic we had, and still have, many obstacles to overcome. Add to this that the team is newly established, and the AI Centre is under two-years-old, makes for an exciting but challenging time. <br>
<br>
We met on 17<sup>th</sup> March 2021, and spent time discussing our experiences, the positives and negatives of the process so far and then focused on designing the pathway for both the internal builds and external AI technology partnerships from idea generation to deployment. <br>

<h2> Retrospective Exercise </h2>
This exercise gave us time to reflect on our working patterns and processes so far with the aim to develop strategies moving forward. <br>
<br>
Five themes came out of the ‘What brings you joy?’<br>
<br>
<ol> 
<li><b>The Team</b> itself came out on top. The skill mix and variety of professionals we work with strengthens our drive and passion to deliver technologies into our Hospital Trust. This diversity does not only come from the CSC team itself, but our colleagues in IT, the AI Centre, radiology, and health economist partners as well. Leadership was a key component to our success (although the jury is still out Haris’s choice of shirt), as was the support from within the CSC team itself as each member has come from a different (clinical and non-clinical) background with varying levels of experience in computer science roles. </li><br>  
<li><b>Open and Transparent Work Ethic.</b> Everyone in the group wants to know the aims and objective of the projects and having roadmaps and pathways to ensure the end goal is met and we are reaching what we set out to achieve. The saying “no question is a silly question” resonates with the group we have an open culture, asking for support is encouraged.</li><br>  
<li><b>Communication.</b> The regular standup sessions with agendas and minutes ensure all members are aware of the whole project portfolio; this is also reflected on the CSC website. As a new team we have ownership over our processes and to some degree, control with the new builds and developments.</li><br>  
<li><b>New and Innovative area of work.</b>The focus on problem solving and defining new processes to optimise patient care as well as health economic outcomes was a common theme that excites the group. We are proud and excited to be working in such a new area of healthcare.</li><br> 
<li><b>Resources.</b> As a new team with strong leadership and purpose with an open transparent work ethic, the resources that are available for us to use and even facilitate integration keeps this group excited about the work we do.</li><br>
</ol>
Five themes around what the team would like to ‘Throw out,’ <br>
<ol>
<li><b>Communication.</b>Due to the nature of working remotely has meant the main channel of is via email and video calls. There can be times of miscommunication, unknown acronyms and lack of engagement or responses from other team members. Tied in with this communication feedback was the feeling of mis-alignment of project outcomes and the lack of a clear direction or leadership.</li><br>  
<li><b>Lack of Project Direction,</b> was expanded by people giving examples of projects not having a clear direction of timelines or intended outcomes, project, ownership and who makes final decisions with regards to elements of the project, including when a project should be stopped.</li><br>  
<li><b>IT pathways,</b>was the smallest negative theme and the thoughts around this were solely focused on the processes of integration and approval processes.</li><br>  
<li><b>Complex Processes,</b> was the main theme in the throw out section. The complexity of setting up a new project pathway is just one example. This is made more intricate as we aim to integrate existing technologies as well as build and integrate their own in-house solutions. Not surprisingly, the logistics of accessing data, multiple hospital software programs and end-user systems, dominated this section of feedback. Other examples of complex processes included the disconnect of documentation and the sub-tasks in the main pathway such as contract sign offs and information governance approvals processes.</li><br> 
<li><b>Time constraints and Expectations.</b> The challenge now is being aware of how to allocate time between different projects and being able to support them all. Further clarification around the role of the team will need to be shared with stakeholders to ensure all parties understand the level of work that can be completed, this will help to manage people’s expectations of the team and what is required of each stakeholder group. The volumes of projects the team supports will need reviewing and it was agreed that dedicated timeslots of each member to complete tasks such as coding should be respected and allocated as necessary.</li><br> 
</ol>

<h2>Project Process Mapping</h2>

After sharing first draft attempts of the process mapping of projects we came together to build on this template and expand on the current practice. <br>
<br>
From the generation of the initial idea, the gap in the market, the unmet need, that could be resolved with AI technology, the next logical step is to look into this area in more depth. <br>
<br>
<b>The Initial scoping phase.</b> It became clear that before any machine learning or algorithms can be built there are some key details that need refining first. It is easy to think this may just be about the aims and objectives and outcome measures of the project but if we want this to work then we need to home in on more details, for example, how will this new technology be of benefit and to whom? What would the expectations be if it is deployed into clinical practice? Is there any work that is already out there regarding this technology or similar technologies? With just these three questions in mind, has any retrospective analysis been completed?<br>
<br> 
<b>A literature review</b> of the current landscape should be completed to look at technologies that already exists and what evidence base they have? What data sets have they used and is this reflective of our practice? We then built on this regarding the resources available, not only in terms of people (Academics, Clinicians, Links with Small and Medium Enterprises) but what software and systems are required to generate the data sets, and down to the topics of funding and time frames.<br>
<br>
This step alone needs refining and the idea of producing a ‘Collaboration Pack’ which would house all this information could be a starting point for us to improve our process. Not only would this Pack act as submission of ideas to the CSC Team but it will allow the transfer of the information included on to other documents as we move through the process.<br>
<br>
The outcome of this initial scoping would be to define the intended output of the collaboration:<b> A)</b> an evaluation of a current AI technology, using retrospective data sets and working with health economists to review the implementation of new technologies, <b>B)</b> to develop and build our own in-house technology to evaluate its use within clinical pathways, <b>C)</b> to use an established TRL (Technology Ready Level Score dependent) for deployment to evaluate prospective data that focuses on immediate outcomes or that can generate service user evaluation outcomes.<br>
<br>
The next step is to refine the processes of inhouse development projects. Thoughts turn to data storage, security, access and back up requirements, enriching the data and data clean up processes as well as the technical development, testing, verification, and documentation of developments. There is now a mass of virtual sticky notes applied to this section of the pathway, the decision is made to pause, to step back and review the work completed today.

<br>
As we left GSTT seeing the sunset over the powerhouse of the nation, with Big Ben hidden behind its curtain of scaffolding, thoughts about how this group can and will change patient outcomes as well as reducing staff burden and costs fueled our passion to continue this journey. Unlike the unveiling of the improvements to Big Ben though, we aim to share and showcase each improvement and progression made with our stakeholders every step of the way.
