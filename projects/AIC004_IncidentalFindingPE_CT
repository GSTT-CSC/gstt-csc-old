| <b>Description</b> | [A computer aided diagnosis tool which will support the clinician for the detection of incidental Pulmonary Emboli during cancer follow up exams. Contrast enhanced CT scans (Thorax, Pelvis, Abdomen) are routinely performed on for cancer surveillance and provide the ideal contrast to detect PE. GSTT has currently 7 days turn-around timescale for reporting CTs, with the risk that the pathology progresses causing morbidity or mortality. The tool will support identification and prioritisation of the scans, reducing delayed diagnosis and enabling earlier ] |

| <b>Project Plan</b> | [amend the following as needed, left here for now for easy replication until we have more solid plans: 1.	Meeting of all persons involved to determine AI specifications. <br><br> 2.	Setting technical and system requirements for AI model. <br> <br> 3. Dataset curation (retrospective). <br><br> 4.	Model training<br><br>5.	Model testing <br><br>6.	Implementation <br><br>7. Audit ] |
