# **Carpal fracture detection in x-ray**

| <b>Project Title</b> | Fracture: Occult Carpal Detection in X-Ray -- Next Steps post TOHETI |
| <b>Clinical lead(s)</b> |  |
| <b>CSC lead</b> | [Dika](/team/dika.html) |
| <b>Rationale</b> | MRI is superior in identification of occult carpal fracture, but is not always accessible. An AI tool to aide clinical diagnosis of occult carpal fractures using x-rays would increase diagnostic sensitivity in areas and situations where MRI is not available.  |
| <b>Modality</b> | X-ray |
| <b>Pathology</b> | Occult carpal fractures (wrists and hands) |
| <b>Description</b> | A computer aided diagnosis tool which would automatically run when either a scaphoid fracture is suspected or if a patient is referred for a hand/wrist x-ray from A&E would increase sensitivity and confidence of diagnosis. Carpal fractures can be difficult to identify and patients with high clinical suspicion are put in a splint and referred to the fracture clinic even if a fracture isnâ€™t seen on the x-ray by the clinician. Subtle lucency of an un-displaced fracture and the significance of a small bone fragment is currently easily missed. A successful tool would therefore increase diagnostic confidence and accuracy and reduce repeated x-rays and needless fracture clinic referrals. |
| <b>Patient pathway</b> | A&E attendance with a suspected scaphoid fracture or hand/wrist injury. |
| <b>Training datasets</b> | TOHETI dataset (held by the health technology analyst) of patients who attended A&E with suspected scaphoid fracture (n=132) of which (n=67) have an MRI too. |
| <b>Consequences of errors</b> | Needless referrals to fracture clinic and needless immobilisation in patients who do not have a fracture; repeated x-rays; referrals to MRI. |
| <b>Goals</b> | An automated computer aided diagnosis tool triggered when appropriate x-rays are taken. |
| <b>Criteria for success</b> | Improvement in diagnostic accuracy and diagnostic speed. |

| <b>Other considerations</b> | Suboptimal views are difficult to interpret. Background of arthritis can make small fractures difficult to see. |
| <b>Project Plan</b> | 1.	Meeting of all persons involved to determine AI specifications. <br><br> 2.	Setting technical and system requirements for AI model. <br> <br> 3. Dataset curation (retrospective). <br><br> 4.	Model training<br><br>5.	Model testing <br><br>6.	Implementation <br><br>7. Audit|
