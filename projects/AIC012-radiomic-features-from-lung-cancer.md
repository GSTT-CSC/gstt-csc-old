# **Radiomic features from CT to predict lung cancer**

| <b>Project Title</b> | AI to extract Radiomic Features from CT images as non-invasive tool to predict outcome of patients with lung cancer|
| <b>Clinical lead(s)</b> |  |
| <b>CSC lead</b> | [Anil](/team/anil.html) |
| <b>Rationale</b> | Radiomic Features (RF) that are extracted from contrast enhanced CT of lung cancer and lymph nodes can be correlated with histology and survival outcomes to provide a non-invasive predictive tool to develop a multi-parametric predictive model to assistive the decisions in patient treatment.   |
| <b>Modality</b> | Thorax CT (contrast enhanced)|
| <b>Pathology</b> | Lung cancer with nodal involvement |
| <b>Description</b> |   The survival rates from non-small-cell lung cancer is associated with TNM grading system (tumour, nodal involvement and metastatic extent), and also protein expression, however the only way to evaluate both is using histology results from an invasive biopsy investigation. Biopsies are also limited in that they may not fully character the tumour and spread of disease. The aim of this project is to use AI to extract RFs from the lymph nodes and lung cancer and correlate them with histology, to assess the RF ability to predict histology and patient outcomes. This will result in a non-invasive tool to build multivariate predictive models and stratify patient treatments.    |
| <b>Patient pathway</b> | Patients receive a contrast enhanced CT then a biopsy for diagnosis and staging of lung cancer, the results of which determine the treatment path.  |
| <b>Training datasets</b> | Pre-operative Contrast enhanced Thorax CTs (2014-2018), collected into a database (n = 500 ~ 600). Option of including recent CTs (2018 – present) with limited data on survival after surgery.  |
| <b>Consequences of errors</b> | Poor RF will develop a model with little predictive value. Mismanagement of patient treatment. Poor research outcomes. |
| <b>Goals</b> | A tool that extracts radiomic features with a high predictive power in predicting histology and patient outcomes. |
| <b>Criteria for success</b> | Well-segmented primary lung lesions and intrathoracic lymph nodes. This will require clinicians’ supervision and validation against manual segmentation. Also, based on this, subsequent important criteria for AI success within this project will be the ability of RF automatically extracted from images to show correlation with histological parameters and outcome data. |
