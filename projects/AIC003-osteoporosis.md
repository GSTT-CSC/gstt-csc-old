# **Osteoporosis**

| <b>Project Title</b> | Cross modality identification of vertebral compression fractures in the identification of background population osteoporosis |
| <b>Clinical lead(s)</b> |  |
| <b>CSC lead</b> | [Dika](/team/dika.md) |
| <b>AI Centre Number</b> | AIC003 |
| <b>Rationale</b> | 77% of scans with vertebral compression fractures are correctly identified and 43% scans recommend referrals â€“ both of these numbers can be improved with AI tool. |
| <b>Modality</b> | CT first, then x-ray, then MRI. |
| <b>Pathology</b> | Vertebral compression fractures (spine) |
| <b>Description</b> | Background osteoporosis is easily treatable if identified, but can lead to complex fractures at other sites if undiagnosed, especially in the hip where a > 50% mortality at 12 months over the age of 80. Currently, 70% of vertebral compression fractures are undiagnosed though they are the most common osteoporotic fracture. This project would work in conjunction with the current fracture liaison service quality improvement project. |
| <b>Patient pathway</b> | Incidental findings, patients present for imaging for other reasons. |
| <b>Training datasets</b> | Clinical datasets are available (CT, MRI, x-rays). Imaging usually performed for other indications. |
| <b>Consequences of errors</b> | A timely identification of vertebral compression fractures which indicate osteoporosis allows the clinicians to refer the patient for osteoporosis treatment. If the osteoporosis signs are missed and the patient sustains a fracture, the fracture is complex and carries a high rate of mortality in older patients. |
| <b>Goals</b> | Increased rates of identification and treatment referrals after identification to reduce occurrence of complex fractures in other sites. |
| <b>Criteria for success</b> | Increased referrals and identifications of vertebral compression fractures. |
| <b>Commercial products available</b> | <a href="https://www.zebra-med.com/bone-health-solution"> ZebraMed</a>. Retrospective and prospective trials are planned to take place in the early 2021. The results will determine whether this clinical problem will be solved with ZebraMed's BoneHealth solution. |
| <b>Project Plan</b> | <strike>1.	Meeting of all persons involved to determine AI specifications.</strike> <br><br> 2.	Agreeing on technical specifications, success criteria and evaluation plan. <br> <br> 3. Dataset curation (retrospective) -- approximately 1000 CTs with spine in field of view, patients > 55 years. Cogstack to be used for cohort selection. <br><br> 4.	Retrospective evaluation (3 weeks, 1000 scans)<br><br>5.	Prospective evaluation live in clinic (2 months) <br><br>6.	Analysis of evaluation results: if successful, then procurement, if unsuccessful, change strategy. After the completion of CTs, we will move on to solve the same problems using other modalities. <br><br>7. Audit|
