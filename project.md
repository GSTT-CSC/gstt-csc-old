# AI project template
Use this markdown file to collect and share the appropriate information regarding each AI project.  

Create a new git branch to work from and give it a name that includes the AI centre project number and description e.g. 'AIC005-occult-carpel-detection-mri'

For every project there should be a dedicated markdown file e.g. lung_nodule.md inside the projects folder.

This should be linked to from the [Work](work.md) page so people can find it.
