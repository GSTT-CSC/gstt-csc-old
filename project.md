# AI project template
Use <a href="/projects/AICODE-template.html">this</a> markdown file (located in Projects folder by the name 'AICODE-template.md') to collect and share the appropriate information regarding each AI project.  

Create a new git branch to work from. Copy the template markdown file and give it a name that includes the AI centre project number and description e.g. 'AIC005-occult-carpel-detection-mri'. Fill in the required fields with your own text.

For every project there should be a dedicated markdown file e.g. AICODE-lung_nodule.md inside the projects folder.

This should be linked to from the [Work](work.html) page so people can find it.
